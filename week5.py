#Recursion

"""
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function.
Using a recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.

Step1 - Define a base case: Identify the simplest case for which the solution is known or trivial. This is the stopping condition for the recursion, as it prevents the function from infinitely calling itself.

Step2 - Define a recursive case: Define the problem in terms of smaller subproblems. Break the problem down into smaller versions of itself, and call the function recursively to solve each subproblem.

Step3 - Ensure the recursion terminates: Make sure that the recursive function eventually reaches the base case, and does not enter an infinite loop.

step4 - Combine the solutions: Combine the solutions of the subproblems to solve the original problem.

# Modules and Packages

"""
The module is a simple Python file that contains collections of functions and global variables and with having a .py extension file.
It is an executable file and to organize all the modules we have the concept called Package in Python.

The package is a simple directory having collections of modules. This directory contains Python modules.

Example packages : Numpy, Pandas

#FILE HANDLING

"""
Python supports file handling and allows users to handle files 
i.e., to read and write files, along with many other file handling options, to operate on files.

Python File Open
Before performing any operation on the file like reading or writing, first, we have to open that file. 
For this, we should use Pythonâ€™s inbuilt function open() 
but at the time of opening, we have to specify the mode, which represents the purpose of the opening file.

# f = open(filename, mode)

# modes available
r: open an existing file for a read operation.
w: open an existing file for a write operation. If the file already contains some data, then it will be overridden but if the file is not present then it creates the file as well.
a: open an existing file for append operation. It won't override existing data.
r+: To read and write data into the file. This mode does not override the existing data, but you can modify the data starting from the beginning of the file.
w+: To write and read data. It overwrites the previous file if one exists, it will truncate the file to zero length or create a file if it does not exist.
a+: To append and read data from the file. It won't override existing data.

"""

file = open('example.txt', 'r')
for each in file:
    print (each)

file = open('example.txt', 'w')
file.write('hello world !')

In Python, with statement is used in exception handling to make the code cleaner and much more readable. 
It simplifies the management of common resources like file streams.

# NumPy ==> numerical python

"""
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.

It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
# https://github.com/numpy/numpy

In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.

The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.

Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.

# PANDAS ==> Data Preparation

"""

Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.

It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.

The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.

Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.

Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.

Relevant data is very important in data science.

Pandas gives you answers about the data. Like:

Is there a correlation between two or more columns?
What is average value?
Max value?
Min value?
Pandas are also able to delete rows that are not relevant, or contains wrong values, like empty or NULL values. 
This is called cleaning the data.
